# 🏠 House Price Prediction

A simple machine learning project to predict house prices based on features such as area and number of rooms. The project explores different regression techniques including:

- Linear Regression
- Non-linear Regression
- Multiple Regression

## 📊 Features

- Predict house prices using custom specifications
- Compare different regression models
- Visualize model performance and fit

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

- Linear Regression – for modeling the relationship between features and price assuming a straight-line relationship
- Non-linear Regression – for capturing more complex relationships
- Multiple Regression – for predicting price based on multiple input features


## 📌 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
- jupyter (optional)
